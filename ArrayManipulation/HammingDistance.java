// Chef likes to work with arrays a lot. Today he has an array A of length N consisting of positive integers. Chef's little brother likes to follow his elder brother, so he thought of creating an array B of length N. The little brother is too small to think of new numbers himself, so he decided to use all the elements of array A to create the array B. In other words, array B is obtained by shuffling the elements of array A.

// The little brother doesn't want Chef to know that he has copied the elements of his array A. Therefore, he wants to create the array B in such a way that the Hamming distance between the two arrays A and B is maximized. The Hamming distance between A and B is the number of indices i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) such that Ai ≠ Bi.

// The brother needs your help in finding any such array B. Can you please find one such array for him?

// Note that it's guaranteed that no element in A appears more than twice, i.e. frequency of each element is at most 2.
